So my thought here is to use Lincoln's notebooks as the open notebook option in Odate. Students would have their own repositories. Then, in DHBox, they'd eg clone their repo to the box:

`https://github.com/o-date/scratch.git`

Do all their futzing in the notebook by making new Rmd files as necessary. They'd save, then run the make command, then git commit, push, back to their repository at the end of the session.

...because I'm not sure how persistent, or for how long, we'd do things.

Oops, when I went to `make`, I had no rmarkdown. So that has to be in the rstudio server.
ditto pandoc, which I got first by

`wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.2.1/pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd64.deb
`

and then `sudo dpkg -i pandoc-1.19.2.1-1-amd64.deb` to unzip it.
